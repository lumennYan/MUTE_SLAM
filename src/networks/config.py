# ESLAM is a NeRF-based SLAM system. It utilizes Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
# to perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in real-time.
# This software is the implementation of the paper "ESLAM: Efficient Dense SLAM
# System Based on Hybrid Representation of Signed Distance Fields" by
# Mohammad Mahdi Johari, Camilla Carta, and Francois Fleuret.
